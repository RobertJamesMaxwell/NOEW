Prior to Lush Yummies Pie Company, Lyle was a lead teacher in Atlanta Georgia through Teach for America where she served as 9th grade English teacher and cheerleading coach. She found herself often shelling out her own money to her girls for uniforms, so she began showing them how to make money through baked goods. After her teaching commitment was completed, she followed her passion for baking and began continuing her education at Le Cordon Bleu Culinary School in Miami in the patisserie and baking program. Jennifer also holds a bachelor’s degree from Howard University in communications and graphic design.\r\n\r\nJennifer later moved back to her hometown of Detroit Michigan and soon went back to her grandfather’s pie recipes. She decided to leave her job and pursue baking full time!  She had very little money and began seeking funding to start her pie business after selling her grandfathers pies at local Detroit events. She always enjoyed watching shark tank and came up with an idea to start participating in pitch competitions, she knew that she just needed a good presentation and she could get all the help that she needed. She tried out for a few competitions, four to be exact and lost all four competitions in a row. With each loss she learned valuable lessons about her business and how to perfect her pitch presentation. It wasn’t long before she would try to pitch again, she had the confidence to tackle any obstacle and so she did. She went out and won over 14 pitch and grant competitions to secure the funding, branding and technical assistance that she needed to give her business a boost!. Jennifer now has her own production facility in Eastern Market. She provides her best love family pies locally to national chain grocery stores, local markets and she ships her pies nationwide through online sales. Today Jennifer’s Lemon Butta Pies have won many awards and she spends her time growing Lush Yummies Pie Company to be a national brand!",

        "biography": "[photo credit: Trenity Thomas]\r\n\r\nSince he came on the scene in 2014, Pell’s been synonymous with ambition. His first mixtape, Floating While Dreaming, captured the spirit of dreaming big and wanting more. Featuring production from Ludwig Goransson (Childish Gambino) and others, Floating While Dreaming announced the arrival of a thoughtful, multifaceted Nola talent. Pell can cut a party record in the tradition of Cash Money and also tap into the city’s R&B scene for a mellow slow jam with all live instrumentation.\r\n\r\nPell’s latest venture? Rebuilding his strong and vibrant hometown with GLBL WRMNG - a new hyper-local NOLA collective of 20+ local artists and producers including Malik NinetyFive, Jzzle, Jelly of Tank and the Bangas, Lil Iceberg, Kr3wcial, and more. On February 19th, GLBL WRMNG will release glbl wrmng vol. 1, an ode to the strength and resilience of their beloved hometown and emphasizes the city’s heroic survival.\r\n\r\nThe R&B side of the city is a fundamental part of glbl wrmng vol. 1, which has been gestating for years. The album aims to capture the beauty, vibrancy, and, most importantly, resiliency of New Orleans—a city that can attest to the harsh realities of climate change—while simultaneously showcasing the artists and producers who are reinventing the city’s sound. It features over 15 different collaborators, fulfilling Pell’s desire to create a platform for a side of the city he says isn’t represented in contemporary hip-hop. While many of the collaborators are close friends of Pell’s, some are folks he’s only known for a year or less—but it doesn’t matter, because sharing the spotlight is the point.\r\n\r\nThe lead single “504” is an instant anthem that encapsulates the project’s mission perfectly. Joined by Kr3wcial and $leazey EZ, Pell intertwined his own success and drive with the indomitable strength of his hometown, telling all the naysayers that this song will soundtrack their second line. The song rides out with live horns joining the beat, a blend that reflects the rich musical history of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nGlbl wrmng vol. 1, just the first entry in what will hopefully be a long series, delivers the richness of New Orleans in 16 tracks, shading in every color and emotion that makes the city one of the world’s gems.",

Beginning with a $60 order of food and an email to his krewe, Devin helped create the largest restaurant-food-to-hospital-worker effort in America. $1.2 million raised in 6 weeks, 90,000 meals to every single ER and ICU in New Orleans (From St. Bernard to Kenner), 10,000 cookies and coffees, and $100,000 in delivery gigs for musicians. \r\n\r\nThen the krewe created \"Feed the Second Line\", which has created $300,000 in gig-work for musicians and black-masking Indians (grocery shopping, beadwork designs) and $130,000 in groceries for culture-bearer elders. This effort is ongoing. \r\n\r\nDevin also led in the creation of \"Hire A Mardi Gras Artist\" which has put 45 Mardi Artists to work and raised over $250,000",

        "biography": "Lisa P. Jackson is Apple’s Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, and served as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from 2009 to 2013.\r\n\r\nAt Apple, Lisa leads the company’s environmental initiatives, global community education programs, product accessibility efforts, corporate giving, and worldwide government affairs. She is also the head of Apple’s newly announced Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.\r\n\r\nSince Lisa’s arrival in 2013, Apple has transformed its environmental footprint. Under her leadership, the company reached its goal of powering its operations around the world with 100 percent renewable energy and is now implementing its industry-leading supplier clean energy program — responsible for adding over 5 gigawatts of new clean energy around the world — to drive the transition to renewable energy with Apple’s manufacturing partners. In addition, Lisa spearheads Apple’s circular economy programs, grounded in the company’s ambition to one day make its products using only recycled or renewable materials.\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama appointed Lisa as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 — the first African-American to hold the position. As Administrator, she focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and achieving environmental justice by expanding environmental outreach to underserved communities and communities of color.\r\n\r\nLisa has been recognized as a leader in business and sustainability in a number of leading publications including Fast Company’s 100 Most Creative People in Business, Vogue’s Game Changers, InStyle’s Badass Women, Newsweek’s Most Important People, TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World (2010 & 2011) and Ebony’s Power 100 lists. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including Princeton’s James Madison Medal, Tulane University’s Distinguished Alumni Award, the Environmental Law Institute’s Environmental Achievement Award, the Corporate EcoForum’s C.K. Prahalad Award for Global Sustainability Business Leadership and The Captain Planet Foundation’s Protector of the Earth Award.\r\n\r\nShe serves on the boards of Tulane University, SF Film, Conservation International and Emily’s List, and is an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.",

        "biography": "[photo credit: Bridgette Aikens]\r\n\r\nSince he came on the scene in 2014, Pell’s been synonymous with ambition. His first mixtape, Floating While Dreaming, captured the spirit of dreaming big and wanting more. Featuring production from Ludwig Goransson (Childish Gambino) and others, Floating While Dreaming announced the arrival of a thoughtful, multifaceted Nola talent. Pell can cut a party record in the tradition of Cash Money and also tap into the city’s R&B scene for a mellow slow jam with all live instrumentation.\r\n\r\nPell’s latest venture? Rebuilding his strong and vibrant hometown with GLBL WRMNG - a new hyper-local NOLA collective of 20+ local artists and producers including Malik NinetyFive, Jzzle, Jelly of Tank and the Bangas, Lil Iceberg, Kr3wcial, and more. On February 19th, GLBL WRMNG will release glbl wrmng vol. 1, an ode to the strength and resilience of their beloved hometown and emphasizes the city’s heroic survival.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to make records with all my hometown friends that didn’t have to be just Pell records that could showcase the talent of New Orleans and what we had to offer,” Pell says. “I wanted to executively produce this record and then give us all something to call back on whenever we were on the road or outside of the city so that we could keep connecting and building together.\r\n\r\nThe R&B side of the city is a fundamental part of glbl wrmng vol. 1, which has been gestating for years. The album aims to capture the beauty, vibrancy, and, most importantly, resiliency of New Orleans—a city that can attest to the harsh realities of climate change—while simultaneously showcasing the artists and producers who are reinventing the city’s sound. It features over 15 different collaborators, fulfilling Pell’s desire to create a platform for a side of the city he says isn’t represented in contemporary hip-hop. “Oftentimes New Orleans is pegged as this murder capital,” he says. “But on a day to day basis, we show each other so much love and this project embodies that.” While many of the collaborators are close friends of Pell’s, some are folks he’s only known for a year or less—but it doesn’t matter, because sharing the spotlight is the point.",
