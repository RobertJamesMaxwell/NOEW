Inclusive marketing also shows that your company has diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) at its core, a message that resonates with a much larger audience.In this session, Dustin and his team at Communify , will show some examples of who is doing it right and give some tips to get you started and stay relevant.

Culture - from Parasitic to Symbiotic,Session,"3/25/2021, 2:00:00 PM","3/25/2021, 2:25:00 PM","In the past, tourism and the consumption of culture was a one-way transaction. We could ""consume"" the culture. Tourism markets the culture - a parasitic approach.This is harmful to our future - as gentrification and COVID have shown. We must recognize that our culture-bearers are our single-greatest strategic advantage that we have over any other city in the world.Feed the Second Line creates the possibi lity for culture to become a symbiotic relationship. By growing our monthly-donor base, we create a robust safety-net for our culture bearers. We currently buy groceries and assist culture-bearers in their needs - for example, roof repairs after Hurricane Zeta or installing a window-air-conditioning unit in the middle of the summer for an elder. Creating jobs specifically designed for black-masking-indians.....All of this is direct support for our culture. And if we shift to this model, we preserve our city's strategic advantage.",DEVIN DE WULF

In case you missed it: The Future of Justice,Session,"3/25/2021, 4:10:00 PM","3/25/2021, 4:30:00 PM","Simone Spence comes back to discuss: Civil justice regulatory reform is underway. It's a movement to create a system that works for all people and replace a system of regulatory reform that perpetuates racial, gender, and economic inequities. In response to the country's racial reckoning spurred by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, among others, there has been a leap-frog of reaffirmation of all things justice. Legal innovation and legal technology startups are leading the charge. The entire purpose of legal technology is to make the law more accessible and easier to navigate for lawyers, clients, and self-represented litigants alike. Technology is the future of the industry, and thus, those who shape the tech will shape the future of justice.",SIMONE SPENCE

Learn How to Infuse Human-Centered Thinking into Your Organization to Navigate Changing Tides,Session,"3/26/2021, 1:10:00 PM","3/26/2021, 2:10:00 PM","Come camera-ready for this collaborative session!Consider the people of your organization – your customers, employees, shareholders, etc. These people hold the power to help you understand the future. Through their eyes (i.e. their needs, experiences, and connections) an organization can see the future. The ability to understand what comes next empowers an organization to make stronger decisions in the near-term, in areas such as product/service design, customer service, employee satisfaction, etc. Is your organization currently doing enough to harness that power? The key to navigating the changing tides of our ecosystem – from new trends to natural disasters – lies within a fluid practice: Human-Centered Design. A Human-Centered approach eliminates assumptions, surfaces implicit bias, and breaks down the walls of organizational thinking to explore possibility through the lives of people who care about, are influenced by, and could potentially be interested in what your organization has to offer. Organizations that harness this approach as a way of business have a wealth of information at their fingertips to better serve their people at all levels and in all situations. Join trepwise for an  interactive workshop on how to begin paving the road to a Human-Centered approach for your organization.",ALLISON SCHILLER ; LAUREN SIEGEL
